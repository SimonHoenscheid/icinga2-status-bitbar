##Description
This is a plugin for the BitBar (https://getbitbar.com/)
It displays the actual status of UP or Down hosts in your status bar.
If all hosts are up or all host problems are handled then you got a "green" status icon otherwise a "exclamation mark". 

Furthermore you get some more detailed information about unhandled hosts and services with direct links to their lists in icingaweb

##Installation
How you install that plugin - please read the installation instructions: https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#installing-plugins

Please fill in your hostname and icingaweb2! *(not the api user)*  user and password before using!

#Notes
- need a better icon for the statusbar
- detailed view for hostgroups
- testing how it works for larger environment (should i limit output to the latest?)
